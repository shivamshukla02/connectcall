# 🛡️ SYNTRIX — Voice AI Incident Commander

**An AI that joins your incident call, listens, thinks, and keeps everyone aligned — without ever pretending to know the root cause.**

Built for **EchoSphere: Agora Conversational AI Hackathon 2026**

## 🎯 The Problem

> A payment system goes down at 2 AM. Engineers, support leads, and business stakeholders pile into a call. Everyone's talking at once — some sharing facts, some guessing, some deciding. Ten minutes in, nobody agrees on what's confirmed, what's assumed, who owns what, or what's already been tried.

Incidents aren't slow because people don't know what to do. They're slow because **nobody is tracking what everyone just said.**

## 💡 The Idea

SYNTRIX joins the incident call as a real participant over **Agora's real-time voice infrastructure**. It listens continuously, and instead of just transcribing, it actively **organizes the chaos**:

| It hears... | It does... |
|---|---|
| *"the payment API is returning 500s"* | Logs it as a **Fact** |
| *"I think it's the connection pool"* | Logs it as a **Hypothesis** |
| *"let's roll back the deployment"* | Logs it as a **Decision** |
| *"Rohit, can you check the DB pool"* | Creates a tracked **Action Item** |
| Two people contradicting each other | Raises a **Conflict Flag** — never picks a side |
| Something sounds critical | **Proposes** an action — but waits for a human to confirm before doing anything |

It never claims to know the root cause. It just makes sure the humans never lose the thread.

## 🔄 The Human-in-the-Loop Guardrail

The one rule this whole system is built around: **the AI never acts alone on anything critical.**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Room as 🎙️ Incident Room
    participant AI as 🧠 SYNTRIX AI
    participant Dash as 📊 Dashboard
    participant Human as 🧑‍💼 Duty Commander
    participant Slack as 📣 Slack

    Room->>AI: "we have a full payment outage"
    AI->>AI: classify → fact + critical:true
    AI->>Dash: push live update (Timeline)
    AI->>Dash: propose action → "Page on-call engineer"
    Dash-->>Human: shows pending suggestion, waits
    Human->>Dash: clicks Confirm
    Dash->>Slack: fires webhook — real message posted
    Slack-->>Room: 🚨 team notified instantly

    Note over AI,Human: If the human ignores or rejects it,<br/>nothing happens. Ever.

## 🧩 What Each Layer Actually Does

<table>
<tr><td width="30%"><b>🎙️ Voice Layer</b></td><td>

**Agora RTC** — every participant joins a real voice channel over Agora's infrastructure, with per-user tracks so the system always knows *who* is speaking, not just *what* was said.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>🧠 Intelligence Layer</b></td><td>

Every transcript chunk is sent to an LLM with a strict instruction: **classify, don't narrate.** It returns structured JSON — type, summary, owner, due date, and a severity flag — never free-form prose. This is what turns a wall of talk into a queryable state.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>🗄️ State Layer</b></td><td>

A live, continuously-updated incident record — facts, hypotheses, decisions, actions, conflicts, and a full timeline. This *is* the shared understanding the whole product exists to protect.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>🚦 Action Layer</b></td><td>

A strict **propose → human-confirm → execute** state machine. Nothing touches the outside world (Slack, tickets, pages) without a person explicitly saying yes.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>📊 Dashboard Layer</b></td><td>

A React command-center that every responder can watch live — Overview, Timeline, Action Items, and an AI Assistant panel — all updating over Socket.io the instant something new is classified.

</td></tr>
</table>

## ✅ What's Real vs. What's Scoped Down

Being upfront about hackathon-scope tradeoffs, because a working honest prototype beats a fake polished one:

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| Agora real-time voice room | ✅ Fully live |
| LLM classification (facts/hypotheses/decisions/actions/conflicts) | ✅ Fully live |
| Live dashboard with Socket.io | ✅ Fully live |
| Human-confirm-before-action guardrail | ✅ Fully live |
| Slack integration | ✅ Fully live |
| Auto-proposal on detected severity | ✅ Fully live |
| Speech-to-text | ⚠️ Browser-native STT (not yet Agora's native Conversational AI STT engine) |
| Jira / PagerDuty integration | 🔜 Stubbed — same architecture, swap the webhook |
| Multi-speaker simultaneous transcription | 🔜 Currently one active mic per client tab |
